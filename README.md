# University Raytracer project
Copy of the code submitted for my university raytracer project. Built upwards from Ken's starter code, which provided code for the framebuffer and object structures. The (included) nanoflann library provides the KNN functionality for the photon mapping, but the photon mapping and raytracing code is my own.

Provided as an example of C-like C++ code that has been made for and reviewed by a third party. The code has been compiled and tested on linux using GCC. The parameters are all hardcoded in main.cpp. The program will take a very long time to run (4+ Hours) unless the parameters are vastly reduced at the cost of image quality. A copy of the teapot ply file has been included for convinience.
